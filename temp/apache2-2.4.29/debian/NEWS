apache2 (2.4.29-1ubuntu4.10) bionic-security; urgency=medium

  - To address HTTP/2 issues CVE-2019-9517, CVE-2019-0197,
    CVE-2019-10081, and CVE-2019-10082, mod_http2 from 2.4.41 (aka
    v1.15.4) was backported into this release of apache2, which
    includes additional bug fixes as well.

  - For CVE-2019-10098, PCRE_DOTALL flag is by default by default to
    avoid unpredictable matches and substitutions with encoded line
    break characters mod_rewrite and the apache core.
